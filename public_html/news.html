                                        Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the extent of a 14 years prison sentence except under 
                                        certain narrowed exceptions. Nevertheless, European Union Law considers abortion as a
                                        ‘Service’ and most of the EU Member States have sufficiently more relaxed access to abortion
                                        services than Cyprus currently does. Taken as granted that EU Law explicitly overrides
                                        Cyprus national law, even on the criminalisation of abortion, it follows that any Cypriot
                                        woman can vindicate her access to abortion, through the EU principle of freedom of services.
                                        This is in relation not only in establishing access to abortion, but also in claiming refund 
                                        for up to the total costs that occurred to the Cyprus woman by being forced to travel to
